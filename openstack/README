This folder contains a script (spark-openstack) for launching Spark clusters on
Openstack cloud platform.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) Development is at early stage so it's not recommended to use the script in production right now
2) At this stage the script has two dependencies: boto v2.9.9 (it's included as a zip file) and
   python-novaclient v1.1. You should install it with "sudo pip install python-novaclient" to get script
   working.
3) At this stage you need to have both Openstack-style and Amazon-ec2 style credentials to run the script.
4) You need special VM-image to be deployed on your openstack, it will be available a bit later in public.
5) You need to correct file "flavors.py" to correspond your Openstack instance types. We need it because
   in typical Openstack installation we have only one Ephemeral disk device.
6) A little later we will get rid of boto dependency and everything will be cool.
